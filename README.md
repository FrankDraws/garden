# Welcome to my Digital Garden 2.0
I created this project just for kicks. I had the idea of publishing selected files from my Obsidian directory using Jekyll. Then turning said directory of selected posts into a subdomain.

The purpose of this project is to keep me coding and tinkering. I chose Jekyll because I like static sites. I'd like to also get to know Jekyll a bit more.

Additionally with the improvements in AI, I can ask questions and get direct answers and hopefully learn a bit quicker.

Here goes nothing!
