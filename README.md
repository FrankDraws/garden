# Garden 2.0

This was supposed to be a simple blog that used markdown files but it didn't work out. I used Jekyll 4.3.2 with the Minima theme 2.5.1. 

I couldn't get images to display. I spent a considerable amount of time troubleshooting with AI but to no avail.

So I decided to delete Jekyll, Minima, and all dependencies. 

Not sure what I'll put in its place yet.
