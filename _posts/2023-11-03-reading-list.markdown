<p>Firstly, I'm not a fast reader and I like to take notes, ponder, talk to myself, and write as I read. Secondly, My wife and 3 children keep me extremly occupied, so it's challenging for me to remain steadfast in my reading. I tend to go days or even weeks without reading a book from this list, then eventually I'll remember and get back to it. It's messy, I know.</p>

<!-- <p>I've also recently began to post about what I've been reading, which is something new for me.</p> -->

<p>As for onliine reading, I enjoy subjects such as tech, thinking, leadership, systems, mathematics, science, and business; as well as browse art and calligraphy from amazing creatives.</p>

<p>Here are 3 articles about systems thinking being applied in the real world:</p>
